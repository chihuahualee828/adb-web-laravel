Database safety + performance rules

Never run SELECT * on large tables.

Always start by estimating scope: use COUNT(*) (with the same filters) or EXPLAIN before fetching data.

Default to LIMIT 50 (or 100) for any query that returns rows.

Use ORDER BY with a deterministic key when using LIMIT.

If the user asks for “all rows”, do not fetch them. Instead: ask for a date range / filters, or fetch in pages.

For exports, use aggregation (GROUP BY) or summaries, not raw rows.

Prefer returning only the columns needed.

If more data is required, paginate with LIMIT/OFFSET or keyset pagination (recommended).
